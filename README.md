# Signal Segmentation Applications

The Signal Segmentation Apps enable users to upload, visualize, and segment signal data. 

Version 1.0 supports a single signal file with interactive segmentation via a range slider and the ability to save the segmented portion. 

Version 2.0 enhances this functionality by handling three signals simultaneously, providing individual plots, shared segmentation controls, and separate save options for each signal. 

Building on this, Version 3.0 introduces full flexibility by allowing users to define the number of signals to segment concurrently, with the system dynamically adapting to display the corresponding plots, segmentation tools, and save options for each signal.
